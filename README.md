# operational_analytics
DTM Unibo project for operational analytics. It predicts songs' popularity.

I've chosen the songs that are "periodically" popular in the United States (Christmas, National holidays songs). I get songs' popularity from trends.google.com and teach my models to predict their popularity based on their previous popularity and exougenous factors such as artists' or corresponding holiday popularity.

The models I've used are Linear regression, Linear regression with binarization​, SVR​, SVR with exogenous data​, keras.Sequential​, auto_arima SARIMA​ and SARIMAX.

You can see the results in plo​t directory and results.txt files.
